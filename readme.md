A [plugin](plugin.js) that automatically pauses when you start up a new game, similar to OpenTTD. I made it because I prefer the game to be paused at the start, as I can plan things out (research, advertising, loans, opening the park, and looking at what I can work with.) [Feel free to implement this into a more extended plugin](license.txt), and I hope, in the near future, that it'll be a gameplay option in the game.
